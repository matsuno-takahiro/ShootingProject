/// 
/// When custom render settings are enabled, this class configures the camera so that the image is
/// rendered to a render texture at the desired render resolution. The rendered image is then
/// blitted into the display backbuffer to be displayed at the actual window resolution. This is
/// necessary if we want to render at a very low retro-resolution (e.g. 256x224) without blurring.
/// 
/// Normally, when Unity is rendered at a lower resolution than the monitor, the image is upscaled
/// with bilinear filtering, which can make the image extremely blurry if there is a significant
/// difference between the render resolution and the monitor/window resolution. Blitting from a 
/// RenderTexture to the display backbuffer allows us to use point (nearest-neighbor) filtering,
/// which preserves the sharp pixels we desire.
/// 
/// If the custom render settings are disabled, the camera renders at the native resolution of the
/// monitor/window.
